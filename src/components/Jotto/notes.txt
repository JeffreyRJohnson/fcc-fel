Dont need to be connected to Redux
  - never updates state
  
Simple Redux
  - Work with success piece of state
  - Action creator creates CORRECT_GUESS action
  - Reducer updates success
  - Input component conditionally renders

Redux Thunk
  - Action creators that fire off multiple actions
  - guessWord 
    - Add to guessedWords 
    - conditionally update success

Async Action Creators and Axios
 - Test action creator that gets secretWord from server
